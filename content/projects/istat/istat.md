## Abstract

This project aims to evaluate the fiscal incentives to counteract the "brain drain" by providing the inequality and equity implications of the tax-benefit policy introduced in Italy in 2010. Indeed, both during the phase of strict targeting and the subsequent relaxation of requirements, the tax incentive has been sufficiently generous and long- lasting to likely generate significant differences in net income among individuals with comparable age, occupational, and educational profiles. An analysis of its implications in terms of vertical and horizontal equity is therefore necessary.
