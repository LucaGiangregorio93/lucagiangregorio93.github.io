## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel global database on estate, inheritance, and gift (EIG) taxation,
which covers more than 160 countries — some with data going back to the 18th century — and
represents over 90% of the world’s population and GDP. Using this comprehensive and harmonised dataset, we document long-term global trends in EIG taxation, and we estimate the elasticity of EIG tax revenues with respect to top marginal rates.
